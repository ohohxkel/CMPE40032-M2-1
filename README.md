 A Flappy Bird remake that feature mouse update, pause update, and mood update.

 Mouse Update could be located at Bird.lua file -- encapsulated a function in update function.

 Pause Update could be simultaneously located on PauseState and PlayState using parameters passing thru changeState. -- semi updated, variables should be inserted in a table to group them, unfortunately having trouble in initializing values when passed thru a parameter. 

 Mood Update could be located at main.lua -- loose update, this should be encapsulated together with the TitleScreenState. Still working on passing parameters to main.lua functions and vice versa.
